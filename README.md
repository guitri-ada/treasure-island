# üèùÔ∏è Treasure Island üèùÔ∏è

## 1. Challenge Outline

### <ins>a) Summary and review of the problem, overall proposed solution.</ins>

Treasure Island is a grid-based game similar to Minesweeper, 
where the player navigates through the grid with the help of generated clues, 
uncovering cells one by one to find all the treasures while avoiding pirates. 
If a pirate is unveiled, the player loses a percentage of their total score. 
The player's final score is the sum of all treasures' values minus any losses 
from pirates.

### <ins>c) Initial working plan, overall approach, development strategy and approach to quality (linked to 1a, 1b).</ins>

**Initial working plan:**

In the initial phase of development, the focus was on establishing the fundamental 
elements of the game. This began with the creation of a base grid representing the 
cells constituting the island. Then, pirates and treasures were integrated into the 
grid, allowing the implementation of the clue system. Following this, the player 
functionality was developed, incorporating a scoring mechanism.  All these elements 
together formed the foundation of Treasure Island. 

**Development strategy:**

Treasure Island was developed using the walking skeleton approach, aligning with the 
Agile methodology. As mentioned above, the aim was to develop the foundational structure 
of the game first and then gradually add features and improvements.
By breaking down the development into manageable steps, I could continuously refine 
the code quality and the overall functionality of the game. This approach also ensured 
flexibility in the development process, resulting in a more robust solution. Regular and 
strategic commits have been made to the Github repository to main a well-organised and 
traceable development history. 

**Approach to quality:**

The approach to quality was to continually try to 'break the code' by rigorously testing 
each new functionality to identify and address potential issues early on. Additionally, 
the code was continually assessed and refactored whenever relevant and necessary to ensure 
an efficient codebase adhering to good practices and standards.

## 2. Development

### <INS>a) Adoption and use of ‚Äògood‚Äô standards (linked to 1a, 1b, 1c).</ins>

**DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself):** The continuous refactoring for code quality 
improvement follow the Don't Repeat Yourself principle. By regularly refining and optimizing
the codebase, unnecessary duplications were minimized, promoting maintainability and reducing
the risk of errors.

**Separation of Concerns:** Separation of concern was enforced during the development of
the game. This approach facilitated clear distinctions between methods and class 
functionalities, enhancing code clarity and maintainability.

**Modularisation:** During the development process, the game logic was broken down
into distinct components. This not only improved code organisation but also promoted 
reusability, aligning with agile development process. Furthermore, modularisation 
simplifies the implementation of new features and functionalities.

**Version Control:** GitHub was used for version controlling. Regular commits were made, 
enabling easy tracking of changes and creating a comprehensive development history. 
Even as a solo developer, this practice ensured continuous refinement of code quality and
helped maintain an organised codebase throughout the development process.

**Testing Practices:** The breaking approach in testing, as outlined earlier,
ensured robustness and quality for every new implementation during the development process.

**Naming Conventions:** Throughout the development, consistent and meaningful name 
conventions were used. This practice enhanced code readability and contributes to
the maintainability of the project, aligning with industry standards.

**Comments:** The codebase has been extensively but briefly commented to improve 
readability and clarity throughout the project.

### <ins>f) Reflection on key design challenges, innovations and how they were solved (with examples).</ins>

One of the key design challenges was to keep a low coupling throughout the codebase and minimise 
class interdependence. To do so, class responsibilities were clearly separated and no unnecessary 
interdependence was implemented.
As we can see in the UML diagram below, the Treasure and the Pirate classes only depends on the 
Island class and the Session class only depends on the Island class. The Player and Leaderboard 
classes do not depend on the Island class but the session class instead, allowing a single player
to play multiple sessions and the leaderboard to keep track of all the scores independently of the
players.
The SessionController class orchestrates the current session and player instances as well as the 
leaderboard instance. Finally, the GameLauncher class takes care of the running of the actual game
which can involve multiple sessions and players.

## 3. Evaluation

### <ins>a) Analysis with embedded examples of key code refactoring, reuse, smells.</ins>

**<ins>Code reuse:</ins>**

- **Coordinates Object:**
The `Coordinates` object provides a reusable mechanism for obtaining unique coordinates, 
promoting code reuse across different parts of the application.

![img.png](images/coordinates.png)

- **GameConstants object:**
The `GameConstants` object centralises constants,
facilitating code reuse and consistency throughout the application.

![img_1.png](images/game_constants.png)


**<ins>Code smell:</ins>**

- **Nested Loops:**
Nested loops in `SessionController` and `isTargetNearby()` might impact 
readability and maintainability. We might want to consider refactoring 
this piece of code for future improvements.
![img.png](images/nested_loops1.png)
![img.png](images/nested_loops2.png)

### <ins>b) Implementation and effective use of ‚Äòadvanced‚Äô programming principles (with examples).</ins>

- **Singleton:**
The `Coordinates` and `GameConstants` objects follow the singleton pattern. 
It ensures that only one instance of Coordinates exists, providing a 
centralised and unique source for generating and assigning coordinates.<br>
  ![img.png](images/singleton.png)
  <br><br>

- **Static (Companion Object):**
The `PlayerInputHandler` class has a companion object containing utility 
functions for handling player input. A companion object in Kotlin is 
similar to the keyword _static_ in Java. In this case, it allows the methods 
to be called directly on the class without creating instances of it.<br>
![img.png](images/companion_object.png)
<br><br>

- **Interface:**
The `CoordinateHolder` interface is implemented by the `Pirate` and `Treasure` classes. 
It defines a common contract (`getCoordinates()` method) that both classes must 
adhere to. This promotes a consistent interface for objects with coordinates.<br>
![img.png](images/interface.png)
<br><br>

- **Type parameter:**
The `isTargetNearby()` method uses a generic type `T` that must be a subtype of 
`CoordinateHolder`. The function takes a `MutableList<T>` as a parameter, 
allowing it to work with lists of objects that implement the `CoordinateHolder` 
interface, in this case lists of `Pirate` or `Treasure` objects. <br>
![img.png](images/type_param.png)
<br><br>

- **Synchronized Keyword:**
The `getUniqueCoordinates()` method in the `Coordinates` object is annotated 
with _@Synchronized_ to ensure that the method can be safely accessed by 
multiple threads, preventing potential concurrency issues when generating 
unique coordinates.<br>
![img.png](images/synch.png)
<br><br>

### <ins>c) Features showcase and embedded innovations (with examples) - opportunity to ‚Äòhighlight‚Äô best bits.</ins>

- **Dynamic Clue Generation:**
The `isTaretNearby()` function in `SessionController` dynamically generates 
clues based on the player's input, indicating the proximity of treasures or 
pirates. This enhances the gameplay by providing valuable hints. The function 
makes good use of Kotlin's functional programming aspects, especially with the 
`any` and `it` keywords. Additionally, the standard for loops are clear and 
easy to understand. Finally, the use of generics `<T : CoordinateHolder>` allows
the function to work with any type that implements the `CoordinateHolder` 
interface, in this case `Pirate` and `Treasure`.<br>
![img.png](images/type_t.png)
<br><br>

- **Session Management with State Design Pattern:**
The Session class employs a state design pattern with different states, where 
states are triggered by three foundational methods: start() update() and end(). 
This design allows for the dynamic management of the game's state, from active
gameplay to session completion. <br>
